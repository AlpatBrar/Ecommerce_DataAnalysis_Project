# Ecommerce_DataAnalysis_Project
The "E-Commerce Data Exploration and Data Modelling" project aims to analyze and model the vast amounts of data generated by an e-commerce platform to gain valuable insights, optimize business strategies, and enhance overall customer experience. By exploring the data and employing data modelling techniques, the project seeks to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations that can drive data-driven decision-making and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the e-commerce business.

Data Collection and Preparation: Relevant data, including customer transactions, product details, user behavior, and other essential metrics, will be collected and preprocessed. Data cleaning, transformation, and normalization will be performed to ensure data quality and consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilizing statistical analysis and SQL queries, we will perform exploratory data analysis to understand customer preferences, popular products, shopping patterns, and other critical business insights.

Data Modelling: Applying data modelling techniques such as machine learning algorithms, regression analysis, or collaborative filtering, we will build predictive models to forecast customer behavior, product demand, and personalized recommendations.

Model Evaluation: The accuracy and performance of the data models will be evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics to ensure their reliability and effectiveness.

Business Optimization: Based on the insights and predictions from the data models, we will provide actionable recommendations to optimize marketing strategies, inventory management, pricing, and customer retention initiatives.

Skills required for this project:- Excel, MYSQL, Data cleaning, Data Loading, Data Analysis, Data Visualization.
